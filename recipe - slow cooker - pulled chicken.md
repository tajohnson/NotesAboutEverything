2 Tbsp. Dijon Mustard
2 Tsp. Worcestershire Sauce

Directions:
Place Frozen Chicken in the bottom of your slow cooker insert and top with the onions.

In a bowl, place the BBQ Sauce, Dijon Mustard, Worcestershire Sauce and Catalina Dressing.

Mix well and pour this mixture over the chicken and onions.


Cook on HIGH for 4-5 hours or on LOW for 8-9 hours.

Shred the chicken with two forks and place it back in the sauce.

Mix it well with the sauce.
