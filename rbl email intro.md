Hello-

My name is Tom Johnson - I'm the founder/CEO of MailRoute, Inc. (http://mailroute.net), a spam filtering company that's been around since 2003. I was also the founder of FrontBridge, the spam filtering service that was bought by Microsoft in 2005 to become MS Exchange Hosted Servces (later renamed Forefront and FOPE).  So I think you can probably tell, I've been very anti-spam and pro-responsible-use-of-email for a very long time. Indeed, when we launched Big Fish (which we later renamed FrontBridge) in 1999, it was the first anti-spam service out there.  We even beat postini to the punch (just barely, but we did :)

You can check out MailRoute's reputation - we're fairly well-known for our spam filtering services.  Our customers are all corporate and personal mail users.  We do not host mass outbound mailers - we are not a MailChimp.  We advertise on a number of tech podcasts like ATP, John Gruber's Talk Show, various 5by5 shows and we used to advertise on TWiT - we're one of the few companies in this space that's refused to be bought out by a big conglomerate, and we're doing everything we can to fight spam for our customers.

We handle both inbound and outbound mail for our customers.  All outbound mail is filtered, but of course, we may miss something now and then.  Even if we miss a fraction of a percent, given that we handle many millions of messages outbound each day, there are going to either be some messages that slip by us.

But what seems to be causing us the most trouble are what appear to be erroneous reports of spam that are, in fact, legitimate outbound mailings.  We have a few customers (not many, just a few), who host mailman opt-in mailing lists.

For example, one, optonline.net hosts the LCDProc mailing list for people building LCD auxiliary displays for their computers:

http://lcdproc.omnipotent.net/mail.php3

This is your standard mailman-type list.  It requires subscription requests, supports an opt-in signup model, and supports unsubscribing.  Yet it appears that a mailing from this list caused one of our addresses 199.89.1.4 to be listed with you.   It's not spam, but for some reason, you think it is.

So what can we do to make this work better with you?  We've listed our networks with you, but what else can we do to keep this from happening in the future?  We're not having issues with any other blacklists - I can't remember how long it's been since anyone else blacklisted us.

I'd be more than happy to talk to someone, or to correspond with them, to provide whatever information you could use to see what sort of responsible email senders we are.

Please help me out here.  We're on the same side - we love your service, and would be happy to support it in some way.  Just please help us stop these false positives!  And if there's a way we could be notified if you see a reported spam, we could do our own investigation, follow up with our customer, and then prevent a listing, then I think we could do a greater service to everybody when it comes to fighting spam.
