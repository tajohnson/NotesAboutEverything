FAFSA codes - can initially list 10 schools
It is also possible to add colleges to your FAFSA by using the data release number (DRN) from your SAR. You can give the DRN to a college and the college can then add itself to your FAFSA, pulling down your FAFSA data. Alternately, you can call the federal student aid information center at 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) and ask them to add the colleges to your FAFSA. They will need your DRN to do this.
