Add 1.5ml of water:
Tirz 15mg vial => 10mg/ml strength
	2.5mg = 0.25 ml
	5.0mg = 0.50 ml
	7.5mg = 0.75 ml
	10 mg = 1.0 ml
	12.5mg = 1.25ml
	15mg = 1.5ml
	
Tirz 15mg vial  0.9 ml water
      5 mg = 0.3 ml
       7.5 mg = 0.45 ml
       10mg = 0.6 ml

Tirz 15mg vial 1.0ml water
      5 mg =0.33ml
      7.5’g =0.5 ml
      10mg = 0.66 ml


     


Sema 10mg/vial
Add 2 ml water = 200 units
5mg = 100 units
2.5mg = 50 units
1.25 mg = 25 units
1 mg = 20 units
0.75 mg = 15 units

BPC-157?

		GHK-Cu (Human Copper tri-peptide)	89030-95-5		
			50mg/vial	10vials/kit	$31 / kit 	25-50 days/vial, 250-500 days/kit
			100mg/vial	10vials/kit	$43 / kit
			
Can mix them:
	I mixed 50mg of GHK-CU with 10mg of BPC-157 and 4ml of bac water in a 10ml sterile vial which 		should last me 25 days.
	The dosage I decided on is 2mg of GH-CU and 400mcg of BPC-157 per day. This works out to 16 		units on a 1ml syringe.

DONE-Or 100mg of ghk-cup with 20 mg of bpc-157 5ml  water.  Then 2mg gel-cu and 400mcg box is 10 units 
50 days worth.  Would fill 2 pen carts 






Injector pen - 8mm. 30-32g



Testosterone.  

Go to 14mg/7 units per day subq.  That’s about 100mg per week.  

Try injector pen?

Subq into thigh or stomach.  At an angle 8 29g needle 


* order 8-12mm 29g needles (test)
* order 8mm 31g needles (peptides)
have some 3ml syringes for reconsitituting, some smaller syringes in case, some extra needles for venting  (I think I have all this)




Injector Pens

Xxx - testosterone 14 mg/7 units daily

Xxx - ghkcu/bpc-157 10 units daily
   100mg ghk-cu 
    20mg of bpm-157
    5ml water
     Into sterile vial then fill 2 carts


Silver - semaglutide 
     10mg sema 
      2ml water = 5mg/ml
      1mg = 20 units weekly


       

Teal - tirzepatide 
      30 mg tirzep (2 vials)
       2ml water (1ml each vial)
       7.5mg = 50 units weekly


 Ideas:

     Belly fat:
         Tesamorelin 2mg/day 8 weeks.  Weekends off
          Ipamorelin 0.5mg/day

	skye peptides - bought blend 10mg tesa + 5mg ipamo
	Plan:
		add 1 ml water
		10 unit = 1mg/0.5mg twice a day = lasts 5 days (1 week)
		
	HT peptide - bought Tesa 10mg (20 vials), Ipam 5mg (qty 10)
	Plan:
		qty 2 Tesa, + qty 1 ipa  = 20 mg tesa + 5 mg ipa   = 2 weeks worth, so I have 20 weeks worth in hand
		Mix with 2ml water
		10 units = 1mg tesa + 0.25mg ipa - take morning and night (both) on empty stomach - 30 min
	

2024-05-12 - stopping Tirzepatide, starting retatrutide
	Initial dosage 0.5mg weekly (half-life is 6-days, so start with once a week.  Do sema glutide weekly as well?
	Reta 10mg vial.  Mix 2 ml water - 5 mg/ml
	Start dosage 1.0mg = 20 units
		1mg = 20 units
		2mg = 40 units
		(as I go to higher dosage, consider doing only 1ml of bac water instaed)
		How long will this last?  	4 weeks x 1.0 = 5mg
						1 week x 2.0 = 2 = total 9mg 
						So I have a 6-week supply.  need to order more around June 01 or s
	
	



2024-05-15 Storage - 
	10mg sema x 10 x 3 = 300 weeks worth
	15mg tirz x 10 x 2 = 40 weeks worth
	10 mg Tesa x 20
	5 mg IPA x 10
	15 mg Reta x 10
