Hi Don-

I'm scrambling these days trying to work everything out with the SBA to try to arrange the loans for the companies I work with, while we watch our revenues crater from this whole virus thing.  So I apologize for some of the brevity here - I've had time only to pull some representative data together for those two categories of expenses you mentioned - Travel and Auto.  I pulled the info for 2017 - 2018 was much the same.

I hope this is enough to satisfy what they need to see that these were business expenses.  I've attached some of the year-end summaries from the different credit cards I use - you can see it's all travel within the US.   While I have customers all over the world (680+ in the US, about 40 in Canada, 30 in the UK, 20 in Australia), most of my travel is domestic.  I visit customers to close deals or negotiate contracts, to help implement our service, help with integrations, etc.  My largest customer ACM - The Association of Computing Machinery ($18000/month) is in NY City.
I have 27 other customers in NY, 12 in NJ, 21 in MA and 12 in PA.  I was in that area on these dates:

	Jan 25-31 - NY, NJ, MA, PA
	Apr 6-14 - NY, NJ
	July 6-18 - NY, NJ, MA
	Aug 31-Sep 3 - MA
	Oct 19-24 - MA, NY
	
Visiting customers like Banner Hill Hosting of Goucestershire MA, Semper Victus in Canton MA, CSM Tech in Cambridge, MA, Tuxedo Park Estates in Tuxedo Park, NY, ACM in NY, NY, Eos LLP in Hackensack, NJ

I typically travel with my VP of Sales and Marketing, or my Director of Support.  I've also taken more employees for group meetings with customers, like in July 2017 - you can see these purchases reflected in the credit card statements.

I have over 250 customers in California - all over the state, and I likewise travel to see them.  I have friends and family in various parts of the state, so there are fewer hotel expenses for those trips.  I have averaged a bit over 20,000 miles of driving per year lately - and most of that is business driving, since I work from home and rarely leave the few square miles around my home.

I think I lumped Uber and Lyft into the "Auto" category when I categorized expenses.  You can see about $2000 in expenses there. 

One other thing I recall Joyce saying was needing to show that people to whom I paid some expenses were corporations or otherwise not in need of a 1099.  I think most of the services I paid for would have been to you (Trojan and Company, to Apple, to Tennenbaum & Kelley, Inc. (C3368442), Island Technologies (islandtechnologies.net, which seems  to be a dba for "Coffin, Inc."  - C1760972).  I'm not sure what more sorts of info is required for this sort of thing.

I also have done work with offshore programmers - I have one pair of invoices handy from one of them, for a now-defunct ipad application I had developed.  The programmer was named Yong Wu, and he is in Beijing China.  I don't think I have to 1099 someone like that, correct?  I've had several programmers in Belarus work with me as well, but I don't think they did in 2017 or 2018.





Do you need more detail than this?
