## Aurora plan

Current: 2 r6g.xlarge in us-west-1


- [ ] Set up global with aurora in us-west-2 (cheaper)  and using r6g.large 
- [ ] switchover to this and see if it's okay.
	- [ ] If so, delete us-west 1 and purchase reserved instances
	- [ ] If not, then consider 1xlarge writer and 2 large reader?

Reserved instances - can apply a purchase of 1xlarge to 2 large, etc....
