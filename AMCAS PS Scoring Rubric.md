## Medical School Personal Statement Scoring Rubric

### Purpose

This rubric is designed to evaluate medical school personal statements in a structured, holistic way. It is based on the principles outlined in comprehensive guidance from admissions experts and academic sources. The rubric assesses the personal statement across four major categories: Content, Structure, Style, and Impact. Each category contains several criteria, scored from 1 (Needs Improvement) to 5 (Outstanding). The maximum total score is 100 points.

#### Note on Adcom Reading Habits

Busy admissions committee members often skim personal statements, focusing on the first and last paragraphs or even just the first and last sentence of each paragraph. To ensure maximum impact, the statement should have strong, concise opening and closing lines in each section.
