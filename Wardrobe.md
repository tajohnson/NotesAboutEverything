When you try it on:

1. Zip it up.
    
2. Raise your arms forward like you’re holding a steering wheel.
    
3. If the hem jumps above your belt line and stays there, it’s too short _or_ too tight.
    
4. Sit down. If the jacket “perches” and you feel it riding up under your ribs, same conclusion.


# Master Wardrobe Planning Handoff — Thomas Johnson (v2.0)

**Purpose:**  
This document is the authoritative handoff for continuing wardrobe planning across multiple regions.  
It consolidates factual constraints, finalized decisions, and a non-negotiable *Style & Presence Doctrine* so future assistants can work effectively without repeating exploratory discussion or drifting stylistically.

---

## 1. Person & Context

- Name: Thomas  
- Age: 59  
- Role: Founder / CEO / entrepreneur (email cybersecurity)
- Build: Solid, athletic; prefers comfort and physical presence over sharp tailoring
- Personal style inclination: authentic, restrained edge; lived-in, not performative

**High-level goal:**  
Appear *locally familiar, grounded, and authoritative* in each region — not flashy, not trendy, not stereotypical.

---

## 2. Measurements & Fit Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Height: 5’9”  
- Weight: ~176 lbs  
- Chest: 40.4”  
- Shoulders: 18.4”  
- Neck: 15.5”  
- True waist: 35.6”  
- Belly waist: 39.6” → **mid-rise bottoms required**
- Inseam: ~29.7” → buy **30”**
- Thigh: 21.9”  
- Calf: 15.1”

**Fit constraints**
- Avoid aggressive taper (legs look skinny otherwise)
- Pants target: **32×30**
- Shorts: **32 waist**, **7” inseam** (6.5–7” acceptable)
- Shoes:  
  - NB 990 = US 9.5 / EU 43 / **2E width**
  - High instep → lace-up footwear preferred
  - Slip-on boots often fail; Chelsea boots only if instep-friendly

---

## 3. Travel Pattern

- Caribbean / Bonaire: ~4 months annually (daily shorts)
- SoCal (LA / SD): ~2 months (summer + shoulder seasons)
- Victoria BC: ~2 months (summer + spring/fall)
- Europe (~4 months):
  - Cotswolds (rural)
  - Ireland / Scotland (rural west coasts)
  - London (several weeks)
  - Dublin / Edinburgh
  - Some continental Europe

**Key rule:** Caribbean capsule is *separate*.  
Cold-weather outerwear and heavy layers are **not packed** for Bonaire.

---

## 4. Color & Material Strategy

### Warm / Sun Regions (Caribbean, parts of SoCal)
- Stone / sand / ecru (not stark white)
- Pale blue
- Soft sage / olive
- Chambray
- Faded navy

### Cooler / North Atlantic / Europe
- Charcoal
- Ink navy
- Olive
- Brown
- Washed black (rarely pure black)

**Interest comes from texture and material, not contrast.**

---

## 5. Style & Presence Doctrine (Authoritative)

### Core Identity
- **Grounded**
- **Private** (information-controlled, non-broadcasting)
- **Worldly** (international, hard to place)

The objective is **local familiarity without explanation**.

---

### Desired Social Effect

When entering public spaces (pubs, hotel lobbies, restaurants):

- People assume I’m a regular (PRIMARY)
- People wait for me to move first (SECONDARY)
- Volume lowers slightly without tension (TERTIARY)

I should **blend first**, then reveal authority through presence rather than display.

---

### Intimidation Policy

- Controlled deterrence is acceptable in **anonymous public contexts** (e.g., walking through cities at night).
- Intimidation must be **implicit**, never declarative.
- Clothing may imply consequence, never threaten it.

**Goal signal:**  
> “I am not prey. If misjudged, that would be regrettable.”

Not aggression — inevitability.

---

### Authority Model (CEO Constraint)

Authority should read as:
- Calm
- Unhurried
- Inevitable

Not:
- Dominant
- Flashy
- Performative

Trust, authority, and independence must coexist.

---

### Motorcycle / Leather Clarification (Important)

Leather — including *motorcycle-origin jackets* — **is acceptable**, even in CEO contexts, *provided it reads as civilian and restrained*.

**Allowed**
- Classic moto jackets (e.g., Schott-type patterns) **without** racing or costume cues
- Minimal hardware
- Clean lines
- Weight and material doing the work

**Disallowed (“motorcycle-coded elements”)**
These are *specific visual signals*, not the jacket category itself:
- Racing stripes
- Excessive zippers/snaps for decoration
- Shiny armor panels
- Logo patches, numbers, or explicit biker symbolism
- Anything that reads as performance gear rather than clothing

**Rule:**  
Leather should read as *accumulated experience*, not identity signaling.

---

### Material & Construction Bias

Strong preference for:
- Weight over sharpness
- Texture over contrast
- Patina over novelty

Avoid:
- Items that look new, clever, or bought “for the outfit”
- Logos, slogans, or overt branding
- Trend-forward silhouettes

---

### Darkness Rule

- Dark palettes are acceptable and often preferred
- All-dark outfits are allowed **only when broken by texture, wear, or material variation**
- Pure black is rare; washed black / charcoal / ink navy preferred

Avoid “poseur” aesthetics.

---

### Geographic Coding

Preference for:
- European, UK, or Japanese brands when appropriate
- Anything that avoids American casual stereotypes

Goal: **hard to place geographically**, not to signal nationality.

---

### Footwear & Outerwear Hierarchy

- Boots > shoes in most non-Caribbean contexts
- Leather is a *material*, not a message
- Outerwear should signal experience, not toughness

---

---

### Other Regions (To Be Built Under Doctrine)

- **SoCal:** warm-weather base + leather/bomber + denim + restraint
- **Victoria BC:** texture, knits, weather layers, overlap with North Atlantic
- **North Atlantic (Cotswolds / Ireland / Scotland):** waxed cotton, wool, rugged boots, weather realism
- **London:** darker, controlled, imposing but not provocative; topcoat and/or leather as appropriate

---

## 7. Shoes (Current / Planned)

- NB 990 — 9.5 2E — owned (travel baseline)
- Lace-up boots (urban authority) — open
- Lace-up boots (rural / weather) — open
- Caribbean sandals + sneaker — owned

---

## 8. Budget Preferences

- Avoid $250 linen shirts or $150 shorts
- Will spend up to ~$1000 on a serious jacket
- Overall non-boot / non-jacket wardrobe target: ~$2000–2500

---

## 9. Instructions to Future Assistant

- Do not re-litigate settled decisions
- Avoid redundancy across regions
- Apply the **Style & Presence Doctrine** to all recommendations
- Optimize for *presence and inevitability*, not fashion novelty
- When in doubt, prefer weight, texture, and restraint
