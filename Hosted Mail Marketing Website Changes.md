maybe something like this.  In my head it's a sort of a trident after MailRoute Filtering

```
    Incoming Mail] -> [MailRoute Filtering] ----> Your Mail Server 
                                            ----> Office365, Gmail, etc.
                                            ----> MailRoute Hosted Mailbox
   
```
