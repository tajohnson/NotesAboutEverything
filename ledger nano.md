Klever, Coinomi and metamask recovery keys in ~tj/Documents/Finance/Wallets.txt.zip  password K.....22	

Klever: holds syscoin ($sys) - 

	

$STRONG mining - there are two nodes (20 $STRONG) set up at 
app.strongblock.com
	connect with metamask (in chrome) (use nano ledger to approve transactions)
	Purchased 20 STRONG for about $10K. (around $500 each)
	Earns about 0.2 $STRONG per day for a stake of 20 $STRONG.  That means it will double every 100 days or so :)
	So at today's prices, staking about $10K of $STRONG should return about 6/strong per month.  That's worth $3000.
		So $3K of return for $10K stake.  per month.  That's about 30% per month????  wow.
	Plan.  Take out 
	
Ethereum Yield Farming
	app.dyp.finance - use metamask
	5 $WETH staked as of 2021-09-08 - 60 day lockup
		DYP at $0.557  ETH at $3515
		The contract converted 5 WETH to 30,297.445493 DYP.
		If it's at 100% APR as advertised, then  in 30 days, should have around 2600 DYP reward around 2011-10-08, which at today's price is worth about $1448.
		So staking about $16.5K of ETH returns about 9% per month.  

Matic Farming:

	https://matic-miner.finance/ - use metamask, set to polygon network
	Staked 2000 on 2021-09-09
	Advertised return is 3% per day.
	Need to either collect or "hire more miners" (ie compound the interest) every 24 hours or so around 2 or 3pm PDT.
	as of 2021-09-09, $matic is at $1.37, so should earn about 60 $matic per day, or about $82.2 per day.  That's a breakeven at 33 days with no compounding
	Watch the contract balance.  Currently over 30K matic.  if it's dropping, consider getting out sooner
	Plan 1: harvest daily for 30 days.  Then, based on health of contract, consider how long to wait.  Need to estimate time until it crashes and burns (see bnbminer.finance to see how it is doing).  If you think it'll go 180 days, optimal would be to reinvest for 110 more days (140 total).  If 365 days, 
	Plan 2: harvest daily for 20 days, and then start recovering the money.  
	Plan 3: Reinvest for 45 days and then start collecting.  at 60 days, that's the max profit
	Plan 4: Reinvest for 50 days and then start collecting.  At 90 days, that's the max profit
	
	Current Plan: harvest until I see the number of matic in the contract dropping.  Then start collecting.

		deposit $8000 to LP, purchase $2000USD of BUMP (about $2760)
		Locked until 2021-10-13

possible idea:  defisaver.com
	do makerdao to leverage 5 ETH.
	2021-09-23 set up with ether at about $3090.  
	Set up with "leverage", borrowing 14000 DAI to start.  Leverage ratio about 215%.  Liquidation price around $2,135.72 ETH
		Leverage is about 1.8x - 9.41 ETH from 5
	boost from 240% to 220%
	repay from 200% to 220%
	






	
Plan
	xrp - sell 70-75% if it hits $10.
