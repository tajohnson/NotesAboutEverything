First Login: ID Proofing 
The first time a prescriber logs in they will be required to complete ID proofing.
After you pass the ID proofing, if your cell phone number is verified you will
receive a text message containing an activation code within a couple minutes. You
will then need to enter this activation code on the signup screen. If we are unable
to verify your cell phone number, we will call your home phone of record or mail
your home address with the activation code. Once you have passed ID Proofing and
entered your activation code, your account will be activated for e-Prescribing!

Instructions  
 
How much does it cost? 
You have 30 days to try out the system absolutely free (no upfront money or credit
card needed). If you are not satisfied with the system, simply cancel within the 30
days and never pay a cent. If you continue to use the system after 30 days you will
be able to sign up for a month to month or an annual plan. Plans start at $28 per
month per prescriber.  
 
EPCS – Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances? 
MDToolbox is certified to be able to e-send controlled substance prescriptions, too.
As required by the DEA, in order to e-send a controlled drug you have an extra “2
Factor Sign off” that is required for each e-send. A digital token is required for
this extra sign off. We have both software and hardware tokens available. You will
have the option to sign up for a token during your ID Proofing or you can sign up
for one later in the Setup & Tools menu. During the 30 day trial, you may try out
the software token for free; however, the hardware tokens must be purchased. See the
attached Stand Alone Flyer for further pricing information.

Telemedicine Prescribing 
The Ryan Haight Act specifies that if you are prescribing a Controlled Substance at
least one in-person encounter should be conducted prior to telemedicine prescribing.
 According to the DEA, this law also allows that during national/state emergencies
telemedicine controlled substance prescribing is allowed without an in person
encounter as long as you are following other state and federal laws and have
conducted an audio-visual type encounter (like using face-time) and you are licensed
in the state the patient resides.     Please see the DEA website for more
information on these laws.
