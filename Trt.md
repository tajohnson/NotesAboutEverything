Tsh:

TSH should be near 1.0, mid-range means misery, low energy, low libido, lack of clarity of thought, low body temperatures, feeling cold, sparse outer eye brows, dry skin, mood/depression issues, lethargy and more - but you are “normal”. And if a doctor treate






For convenience and consistency when mixing HCG powder, create a solution = 2000iu/ml 

11000iu mix with this much solvent-----> Add 5.5ml bacteriostatic water
10000iu mix with this much solvent-----> Add 5.0ml bacteriostatic water
8000iu mix with this much solvent------> Add 4.0ml bacteriostatic water
5000iu mix with this much solvent------> Add 2.5ml bacteriostatic water

For affordable lab tests please use www.DiscountedLabs.com
		
		
		Testosterone replacement therapy- Target Blood Test Limits
		
		
		Hematocrit under 53
		
		PSA under 3 (4 is max since doctors will not prescribe TRT at this number)
		
		Estradiol (ultrasensitive) between 20-50 pg/mL
		
		Blood pressure under 135/85
		
		Estimated Glomerular (eGFR) (kidney function) over 60 
		
		Liver enzymes not elevated over 20 percent of top value of reference range
		
		TSH under 2.5
		
		Total Testosterone over 500 ng/dL
		
		Free Testosterone equal or above 2 percent of total
		
		If donating blood to bring hematocrit down, ferritin never under 30 ng/mL or micrograms/liter
		
		Free T3 (if hypothyroid and on treatment) in the upper quartile of range. (depending on range it can be 3.7- 4.2 pg/mL)
		
		
		HDL over 40 mg/dL
		
		
		
		OPTIMUM REQUIRED LAB WORK (Preferred but not mandatory)
		
		
https://www.discountedlabs.com/trt-male-hormone-wellness-follow-up-panel-option		
	x	1 ------- Estradiol- ultrasensitive via LC/MS test (not EIA!) [Quest Labs code 30289]
		(Labcorp code: 140244) (baseline, week 6 or 8, month 6)
		
		GOAL: 20-50 pg/mL
		
	x	2 ------- Testosterone, Free, Bio/Total (LC/MS/MS) (baseline, week 6-8, month 6, then yearly)
		
		GOAL: Total testosterone oer 500 ng/mL and free T 2 percent or more of total T.
		
		3 ------- DHEAs (baseline, month 6, month 12 (if supplementing))
		
	x	4 ------- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel w/EGFR (baseline, week 6-8, month 6 and then once a year)
		
		GOAL: Normal CBC including liver enzyme elevations under 20 percent and eGFR over 60
		
	x	5 ------- CBC w/ diff/PLT (baselines, week 6-8, month 6 and then once or twice per year)
		
		GOAL: Normal CBC
		
	x	6 ------- Lipid profile (fasting sample) (baselines, month 6, then once per year unless high)
		
		GOAL: Normal lipids
		
	x	7 ------- T3, free (for those with low thyroid symptoms)
		
		GOAL: Upper quartile free T3
		
	x	8 ------- T4, free (for those with low thyroid symptoms)
		
		Goal: Normal free T4
		
	x	9 ------- Ultrasensitive TSH (baseline, month 6, yearly after that depending on value and treatment)
		
		GOAL: TSH under 2.5
		
	x	10 -------- Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) (Baseline before testosterone treatment, 6-8 weeks after and then yearly)
		
		GOAL: PSA under 3
		
		11-------- LH and FSH (for men not on testosterone yet)- Used to diagnosed primary or secondary hypogonadism. Do not waste money testing your LH and FSH if you are on testosterone since they will be undetectable.
		
		For those with excessive fatigue: Saliva Cortisol + DHEA (4 specimens during one day) (you can wait for after 6 weeks on TRT). Ferritin is also a test that can be considered.
		
		GOAL: Normal cortisol graph and values along with proper cortisol/DHEA ratios
