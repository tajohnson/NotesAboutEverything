Read these files:
- `TODO - Work.md`
- `TODO - Personal.md` (if it exists)
- Any other `TODO*.md` or `TODO*.txt` files

Provide:
1. Count of incomplete items (`- [ ]`) vs completed (`- [x]`)
2. List of URGENT items
3. Brief summary of other pending items by category
4. Flag any items that seem stale or might need attention
